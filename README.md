The completion of this project, “Online PC Mart”, marks an important milestone in my MCA program. This project has been undertaken as part of the academic curriculum with the objective of transforming theoretical knowledge into a practical, real-world application.
In today’s digital age, purchasing a computer system is often confusing for users due to compatibility issues, a lack of proper guidance, and the complexity of comparing prebuilt options. The Online PCMart , developed provides an online solution that addresses these challenges.
The platform allows users to build their own custom PC by selecting compatible components, or directly choose from a range of prebuilt systems. Additionally, the system provides filtered prebuilt options tailored for different user needs such as Gaming PCs, Professional PCs, or Basic PCs, with the ability to filter further by budget range, making the selection process simpler and more user-friendly.
Key features of the system include the ability to save custom builds for future use and purchase PCs directly online, whether they are user-built configurations or prebuilt systems. This ensures that users can either experiment and refine their builds at their convenience or proceed directly to buy the system that best suits their needs.
The application is developed using React for the front end, and Spring Boot for the back end, with MySQL as the database. This combination ensures a robust, scalable, and efficient environment for managing components, user preferences, saved builds, and orders.
The development of this project has been a valuable learning experience, enabling me to practically apply concepts of software engineering, system design, and full- stack development. It has helped me gain confidence in creating user-centric solutions that combine both functionality and usability.
We sincerely hope this project serves as a useful resource and contributes to simplifying the computer-buying experience for users while also being of academic value to future learners
